# Dog Face Detection in Images with YOLOv8 and Ultralytics

This repository demonstrates how to implement **object detection** using the YOLOv8 model with Ultralytics to detect dog faces in images. The project leverages a pre-trained YOLO model to accurately detect and localize dog faces, a task that falls under the category of object detection.

The dataset used for training and testing comes from [Dog Face Detection (YOLO Format)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wutheringwang/dog-face-detectionyolo-format), which contains labeled images specifically tailored for identifying dog faces. The model has been fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting dog faces across a variety of images.

## Key Features:
- **YOLOv8 for Object Detection**: Utilizes the latest version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect dog faces in real-time, offering fast and accurate results.
- **Ultralytics Integration**: Makes use of Ultralytics' seamless implementation of YOLOv8, which simplifies the training and deployment process.
- **Pretrained Model**: Starts with a pretrained YOLOv8 model to speed up training and enhance accuracy, taking advantage of the robust object detection capabilities of YOLO.

This project demonstrates the power of combining **YOLOv8's object detection capabilities** with **Ultralyticsâ€™ ease of use**, enabling efficient and accurate detection of dog faces in images.
